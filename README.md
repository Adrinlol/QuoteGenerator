# React Quote Generator

React Application that uses API from [Camperbot](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp-Montreal/camperbot).

## How it works
- "Tweet" button will pop-up a new window so the user can share the current quote on Twitter.
- "New Quote" simply generates another quote using Math.floor(Math.random()) and the .map method.
